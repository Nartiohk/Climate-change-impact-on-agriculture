# Climate Change and Agriculture Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Climate_change.ipynb) that analyzes the impact of climate change on agriculture using data visualization and correlation analysis.

## Contents

Data Loading: Reads climate and agriculture data from a CSV file.

Data Processing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.

Correlation Analysis: Uses a heatmap to visualize relationships between climate factors and agricultural yield.

Visualization: Includes graphs and charts using matplotlib, seaborn, and altair.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:

``` pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn altair jupyter ```

## Usage

Open the notebook in Jupyter:

``` Climate_change.ipynb ```

Run the cells sequentially to analyze the data.

## Data

The analysis is based on a dataset (climate_change_impact_on_agriculture_2024.csv) that contains climate and agricultural metrics.

## Results

The heatmap shows correlations between precipitation, temperature, pesticide use, and crop yield.

Higher precipitation tends to be positively correlated with increased crop yield.
